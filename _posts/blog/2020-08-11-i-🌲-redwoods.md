Giant sequoias and California redwoods (also called coast redwoods) are nature's skyscrapers. These enormous trees exist primarily in Northern California, Oregon and Washington and though they have a number of common characteristics, including distinctive cinnamon-red bark, they are different species.

## Giant sequoias

Giant sequoias can grow to be about 30 feet (9 meters) in diameter and more than 250 feet (76 m) tall. The biggest of these behemoths is [General Sherman](http://www.nps.gov/seki/naturescience/sherman.htm), a giant sequoia in [Sequoia National Park](http://www.nps.gov/seki/index.htm). General Sherman stands 275 feet (84 m) tall, has a 102-foot (31 m) circumference, and weighs an incredible 2.7 million lbs. (1.2 million kilograms).

Giant sequoias can live to 3,000 years, with the [oldest](https://www.livescience.com/29152-oldest-tree-in-world.html) on record living more than 3,500 years. When they die, it is often indirectly because of root rot or another weakening of the base. Fire, root rot and dry spells do not typically affect the whole tree but if they destabilize the base, gravity can eventually take the tree down, according to [Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/are-giant-sequoia-trees-succumbing-to-drought/). This process takes a long time, as evidenced by the fact that sequoias are some of the longest living organisms on the planet.

Mature sequoias lack branches on the lower half of their trunks. Sequoia trunks taper as they rise, forming a rounded top where individual branches sweep downward. Their green leaves are small, scale-like, and arranged in spirals. Both male and females cones are carried on the same tree.\[0]
